 #Answer 1 Itâ€™simportant to keep data aggregated in order to protect privacy and instill transparency. Algorithms are currently being used for everything from machine thinking and autonomous cars, to data science and predictive analytics. The algorithms used for data collection allow companies to see very specific patterns and behavior in consumers all while keeping their identities safe

#Information science field must comprehend what data is personal and delicate and identify the ways to utilize such information. When information on consumers is collected without consent, it must be scrubbed of insight that can cause the figures to be personally identifiable.

#A data scientist has to always maintain transparency between the client and themselves. Professionals should always keep the clients well informed about the different ways the project is being handled, i.e., a data scientist must keep the clients updated about things like what data is being used, where is it being used, and how it is being used. 
#Answer2 Ggplot graphs must include the Title , as title shows what kind of relationship is going to be shoewn The second components can be the giving a proper name to the x and y axis as not giving a names to axis will lwaya creatae a confusion.

#Answer 3 
#Correlation coefficient is all about establishing relationships between two variables. Some properties of correlation coefficient are as follows:

#1) Correlation coefficient remains in the same measurement as in which the two variables are.

#2) The sign which correlations of coefficient have will always be the same as the variance.

#3) The numerical value of correlation of coefficient will be in between -1 to + 1. 
#ANSWER 4 From the determined coffecient of father it can be clearly seend that te relation betweeen father height is some what shows aprositive proportionality with the sons height as the coffecient of father is postive , though its show a moderate relationshipmnot a strong one.
